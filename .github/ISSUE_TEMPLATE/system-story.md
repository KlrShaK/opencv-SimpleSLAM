## Tasks to do 
- [ ] Set up the development environment and install all required dependencies (PyTorch for LightGlue/ALIKED, OpenCV-Python, Ceres Solver). 
- [ ] Build and configure Ceres Solver (C++ library) and ensure it can be called from Python (via pybind11 or Python bindings).
- [ ] **Setup and Test Running [LightGlue that works with ALIKED](https://github.com/cvg/LightGlue),** examine what kind of outputs do you get, ensure the output is in a preferred format where we can directly integrate with Visual Odometry Pipeline.
- [ ] Initialize a code repository with a clear module structure (e.g., feature_extraction, tracking, mapping, optimization) and set up continuous integration for building C++ components

## Description

Just the initial Setup before actual work begins, should be done in the Community Bonding Period
